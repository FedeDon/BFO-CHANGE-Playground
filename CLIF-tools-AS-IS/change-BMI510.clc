Axiomatization of change in BFO2020 as described in the FOIS 2025 paper
Towards Representing Change in the BFO

History:
 - Since 2025/03/15:
 -	corrected ett-03: added process-boundary as exclusion next to process
 -  corrected ins-03: added that t1 and t2 may not be identical and that c must exist at t2
 -  time indexing removed from happens-in as it is between occurrents
To be done:
	- distinct declarations including with BFO2020
	- disjoint declarations
	- further subtyping of changes (increases, decreases, motions, part loss and acquisitions, ...)
	- tighter integration with BFO2020 relations
	- ...'
