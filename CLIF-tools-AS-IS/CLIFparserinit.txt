% INIT-file to parametrize the behavior of the BFO2020style-CLIFparser
% The file is loaded using the Prolog 'include(+File)' directive and must conform to the specifications for files appropriate to be included.
% Lines starting with '%' are comments. Text appearing after '%' in a line too.

% The next line, when not commented out, forces the program to start immediately after double clicking the source file under MS Windows environment. 
:- initialization(once(((run ; true), halt))).
% When the previous line is commented out, type 'run.' to start the program.

%% projectname(string)			% OPTIONAL
								% Prefixes each output file with the provided string followed by '-'
								% If no valid projectname is provided, it will default to "ANONYMOUS"
projectname("BCHANGE").			% Set projectname to BCHANGE


%% ontology(string, stringlist)	% REQUIRED
								% Identify specific files in <stringlist> as belonging to the ontology named in <string>
								% <stringlist> must be a list of strings in a format acceptable for filenames within the operating system
								% The ontology name will be used as prefix for axiom IDs provided in the CLIF files.
								%	For example, if the ontology name is "BFO", the axiom with index 'udu-1' will be prefixed as 'BFO-udu-1'.
								% Multiple occurrences allowed but no expanded filenames may overlap over distinct ontologies
ontology("BFOCE",["*.clc"]).	% Declare all filenames with extention 'clc' as belonging to BFOCE
ontology("BFO",["*.cl"]).


%% ont_uses(string, stringlist)	% OPTIONAL
								% Declare the ontology with name in <string> as dependent on ontologies named in <stringlist>
ont_uses("BFOCE",["BFO"]).


progress_notification(minimal).	% options are: minimal, verbose. 'verbose' is for debugging CLIF-files in case of parse-errors

minimum_constant_length(1).		% set minimum character length for non-outdiscourse constants. If omitted or non-integer
								%   given, defaults to 2.

typo_detection(0.95).			% level for approximate detection of term similarity to identify possible spelling mistakes. 
								%	lower levels increase sensitivity at the cost of false positives
								%	higher levels decrease sensitivity at the cost of false negatives
								%	reasonable values are between 0.8 and 0.98
								%	defaults to 0.95 if omitted or unacceptable value provided

non_typo_display(3).			% possible typo's are detected on the basis of deviations from similar term with higher occurrence
								%	all occurrences of term suggestive of typo are displayed
								%	this setting shows also the occurrences of the non-typo term when it occurs less or equal than set
								%	default when non-set is 3

odd_pred_struc(5).				% threshold for displaying abnormal predicate structures. Default = 5.	

rare_term_use(2).				% threshold for warning about terms used less or equal than number of times set. default = 2. 
								%	these may be typo's without similarity to other terms, or terms with have little effect on reasoning.

missing_pred_percent(80).		% threshold to force warning about potentially missing predicate for constant in ontology as compared
								%	to other constants in the ontology, or an ontology which is used by the ontology.
								%	Default is 80, allowed values is between 0 (everything shown) to 100.
